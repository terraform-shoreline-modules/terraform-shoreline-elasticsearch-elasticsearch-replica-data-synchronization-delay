### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Elasticsearch replica data synchronization delay

This incident type refers to a delay in the synchronization of replica data in an Elasticsearch cluster. Elasticsearch is a search engine that allows for real-time search and analysis of data. In a cluster, data is distributed across multiple nodes to improve performance and ensure high availability. Replica data is a copy of the primary data that is stored on a different node in the cluster. The delay in synchronization of replica data can cause inconsistencies in the search results and affect the performance of the cluster. This issue can occur due to various reasons such as network latency, hardware failure, or software bugs.

### Parameters

```shell
export ELASTICSEARCH_ENDPOINT="PLACEHOLDER"
export INDEX_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"
export ELASTICSEARCH_NODE_IP="PLACEHOLDER"
export DESIRED_SHARD_ALLOCATION="PLACEHOLDER"
export DESIRED_THREAD_POOL_SIZE="PLACEHOLDER"
export PATH_TO_ELASTICSEARCH_CONFIG_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"
export DESIRED_HEAP_SIZE="PLACEHOLDER"
export REPLICA_SHARD_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check Elasticsearch cluster health status

```shell
curl -s ${ELASTICSEARCH_ENDPOINT}/_cluster/health?pretty
```

### List all Elasticsearch nodes in the cluster

```shell
curl -s ${ELASTICSEARCH_ENDPOINT}/_cat/nodes?v
```

### Check the status of Elasticsearch indices

```shell
curl -s ${ELASTICSEARCH_ENDPOINT}/_cat/indices?v
```

### Check the number of replicas for each Elasticsearch index

```shell
curl -s ${ELASTICSEARCH_ENDPOINT}/_cat/indices?v&h=index,replica
```

### Check the status of Elasticsearch replicas for a specific index

```shell
curl -s ${ELASTICSEARCH_ENDPOINT}/${INDEX_NAME}/_shard_stores
```

### Check the status of Elasticsearch shards for a specific index

```shell
curl -s ${ELASTICSEARCH_ENDPOINT}/${INDEX_NAME}/_cat/shards
```

### Check the disk usage of Elasticsearch nodes

```shell
curl -s ${ELASTICSEARCH_ENDPOINT}/_cat/allocation?v
```

### Check the network latency between Elasticsearch nodes

```shell
ping ${ELASTICSEARCH_NODE_IP}
```

### Check the disk usage of Elasticsearch nodes

```shell
df -h
```

### Check the CPU usage of Elasticsearch nodes

```shell
top
```

### If the replica shard synchronization is stuck, try to force a sync or reset the replica shard.


```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Set the Elasticsearch index and replica shard name
INDEX=${INDEX_NAME}
REPLICA_SHARD=${REPLICA_SHARD_NAME}

# Check if the replica shard synchronization is stuck
REPLICA_STATUS=$(curl -s -XGET "http://localhost:9200/_cat/shards/$INDEX" | grep "$REPLICA_SHARD" | awk '{print $10}')
if [ "$REPLICA_STATUS" == "STARTED" ]; then
  echo "Replica shard synchronization is not stuck"
  exit 0
else
  # Replica shard synchronization is stuck
  echo "Replica shard synchronization is stuck"

  # Try to force a sync
  curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9200/$INDEX/_flush/synced"

  # Reset the replica shard
  curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9200/$INDEX/_settings" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{"index": {"blocks": {"read_only_allow_delete": null}}}'

  # Check if the replica shard synchronization is fixed
  REPLICA_STATUS=$(curl -s -XGET "http://localhost:9200/_cat/shards/$INDEX" | grep "$REPLICA_SHARD" | awk '{print $10}')
  if [ "$REPLICA_STATUS" == "STARTED" ]; then
    echo "Replica shard synchronization is fixed"
    exit 0
  else
    echo "Failed to fix replica shard synchronization"
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

## Repair

### Optimize Elasticsearch configuration: Elasticsearch configuration can be optimized for better performance. This includes settings like thread pools, heap size, and shard allocation. Optimizing these settings can help improve the speed of data synchronization.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Set variables
ES_CONFIG_FILE=${PATH_TO_ELASTICSEARCH_CONFIG_FILE}
THREAD_POOL_SIZE=${DESIRED_THREAD_POOL_SIZE}
HEAP_SIZE=${DESIRED_HEAP_SIZE}
SHARD_ALLOCATION=${DESIRED_SHARD_ALLOCATION}

# Update Elasticsearch configuration file
sed -i "s/thread_pool.size: .*/thread_pool.size: ${THREAD_POOL_SIZE}/" $ES_CONFIG_FILE
sed -i "s/-Xmx[0-9]+[MG]*/-Xmx${HEAP_SIZE}/" $ES_CONFIG_FILE
sed -i "s/-Xms[0-9]+[MG]*/-Xms${HEAP_SIZE}/" $ES_CONFIG_FILE
sed -i "s/cluster.routing.allocation.enable: .*/cluster.routing.allocation.enable: ${SHARD_ALLOCATION}/" $ES_CONFIG_FILE

# Restart Elasticsearch service
systemctl restart elasticsearch.service
```
